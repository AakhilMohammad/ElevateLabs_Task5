# ElevateLabs_Task5

The cleaned dataset contains 891 rows and 11 columns, with all missing values handled and the Cabin column removed due to its sparsity.

## Cleaning Summary
Age: 177 missing â†’ filled with median age = 28.0

Embarked: 2 missing â†’ filled with most common port = 'S'

Cabin: Dropped due to over 77% missing

Dataset now has no missing values

# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, revealing insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and the effect of various features on survival outcomes.

## EDA Objectives

- Understand dataset structure and quality
- Clean and preprocess missing or inconsistent data
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualize relationships using matplotlib/seaborn
- Identify key factors influencing survival

---

##  Data Cleaning Techniques

- **Missing Values**: Imputed `Age` with median; filled `Embarked` with mode.
- **Dropped Columns**: Removed or transformed `Cabin` due to high missingness.
- **Outliers**: Transformed `Fare` to normalize skewed data.
- **Encoding**: Converted categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked`.

These steps directly impacted the clarity and accuracy of insights during analysis.

---

##  Key Findings

- **Sex**: Females had significantly higher survival rates.
- **Pclass**: First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Age**: Children had higher chances of survival.
- **Fare & Embarkation**: Higher fares and certain embarkation points (like 'C') correlated with better survival.
